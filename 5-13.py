Hi, Johnny! These are a couple practice problems that you can work on
at home or in your free time. There is no single "correct" answer,
so you can solve these problems in many different ways. If you get stuck
on one, just move on to another problem and we can go over all these
the next time we meet.
'''

'''
The first thing you should do is make sure you can run this file.
In the top right, next to the green 'run' button, click on the box
-> Edit Configurations. Then in the top left click on the +, click python.
Then in the top box, change 'unnamed' to 'practice problems'.
Then click on the folder in the script path box, then find the name of 
this file (5-13 I think), click ok, and then click ok in the button right.
Now you should be able to press the play button and it will print
out the print line below.
'''

# print('Congratulations! You set up your first python file!')

'''
Now, let's move on to some problems!

1.) Make a list with the numbers 0-10 in it and print it out.
'''
# print([i for i in range(-1,9)])

'''
2.) Use a for loop and the range function to print out the numbers 
    between 0 and 500. 
'''
# for i in range(0,501):
#     print (i)



'''
3.) Get user input (use the input function) and print out:
    -"You typed 1." if the user types 1, 
    -"You typed 2." if the user types 2,
    -"Hello" + whatever the user types in, if the user types in anything that is not a 1 or 2.

# if ILikeToEatMacaronieAndCheeseWileWatchingTvPsSubscribeToDenisDailyAndJdAndMyUsernameIsThis =="1":
#     print("ILikeToEatMacaronieAndCheeseWileWatchingTvPsSubscribeToDenisdailyAndJdAndMyUsernameIsThis is1")
# if ILikeToEatMacaronieAndCheeseWileWatchingTvPsSubscribeToDenisDailyAndJdAndMyUsernameIsThis =="2":
#     print("2")
# if ILikeToEatMacaronieAndCheeseWileWatchingTvPsSubscribeToDenisDailyAndJdAndMyUsernameIsThis == "hello":
#     print ("hello")
# else:
#     print("else")

4.) Print out "Hank the tank" 10 times.
'''






'''
5.) Draw the triangle using the symbol "." and the bottom row having 150 .'s.
    It should look like:
    .
    ..
    ...
    ....
    .....

'''



'''
6.) Print out all the even numbers between 0 and 100.
'''




'''
7.) Print out the square for all the numbers between 0 and 100.
    It should start out: 0 1 4 9 16 ...
'''



'''
8.) Make a list with 10 words in it and then print out each word using a for loop.
'''




''''
9.) Make a list of 10 numbers and add them all up using a for loop.
    Then print out that result.
'''




'''
10.) Ask a user for 2 numbers, then print out the sum of those numbers.

Super Challenge: Senator Problem

Let's learn who can be a US senator. A senator must fulfill all of 
the following 3 requirements:
    1.) Be at least 30 years old.
    2.) Be a US citizen for at least 9 years
    3.) Live in the state they want to represent.
They must meet all 3 requirements to be a senator. If they meet 0, 1, or 2,
they are not eligible to be a senator.

ex.) Puddle is 45, lived in the US her whole life, and lives in Illinois,
        which she wants to represent, so she IS eligible to be a senator.
        
    Jimmy John is 45, has been a US citizen for 6 years, and lives
    in Illinois which he wants to represent. Since Jimmy John, has not
    been a US citizen for at least 9 years, he IS NOT eligible to 
    be a senator.
    
Your task is to write a program that asks the user for 3 things:
    1.) What is their age?
    2.) How long they have been a US citizen?
    3.) Do they live in the state they represent?

Then the program either says:
    -"You are eligible to be a US senator" or
    -"You are NOT eligible to be a US senator"
